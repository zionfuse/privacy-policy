      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="small">This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Daily Activity Tracker</strong> (the "App") collects, uses, and stores information when you install and use the App on your mobile device.</p>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Activity Data:</strong> The App stores items you enter such as activity text and the exact <em>date and time</em> the activity was recorded (a timestamp). Each activity is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> The App may access basic device capabilities required by the platform (for example, local storage paths) but does not collect personal identifiers (name, phone number) automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>No Automatic Cloud Sync:</strong> By default, the App does <strong>not</strong> transmit your activity data to any server, third party, or cloud service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Store and Protect Your Data</h2>
      <p class="small">All activity data is stored locally on your device using an encrypted-friendly local database. The App does not attempt to back up or send data off-device unless you explicitly use a feature that exports data (for example, a manual backup or share/export function — if available).</p>
      <p class="small">You are responsible for any device-level backups (for example, if your device is configured to back up app data to a cloud service that you control).</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services and Libraries</h2>
      <p class="small">The App uses open-source libraries (for example local storage libraries) to provide offline functionality. These libraries are used only to store and read data on-device. We do not use analytics or advertising SDKs that send your activity data to third parties.</p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage access:</strong> Required to store your activity data locally. No files are uploaded or shared without your action.</li>
        <li>Any additional permissions will be requested at runtime with a clear explanation of why they are needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view your activity entries directly in the App at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can edit or delete entries from within the App. Deleting an entry removes it from local storage immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Export / Delete:</strong> To request a full export of your data or for assistance with deletion, please contact us at the address below. Because data is stored locally, you may also delete the App or clear the App data from your device settings to remove all stored entries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p class="small">The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal data through the App, please contact us to request removal.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p class="small">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the effective date shown at the top of this page. Significant changes will be described within the App where possible.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p class="small">If you have questions, requests, or privacy concerns, please contact us at:</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:contact@zionfuse.com.ng">contact@zionfuse.com.ng</a></p>

      <h2>Legal &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p class="small">This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the country where the App publisher is located. Nothing in this policy limits your statutory rights under applicable local law.</p>
